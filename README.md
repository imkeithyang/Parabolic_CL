# Parabolic Continual Learner
## Code base for Parabolic continual learner

The Parabolic PDE based continual learning algorithm is implemented in ```models/er_parabolic.py```. This code base is derived from the continual learning benchmark repository [mammoth](https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth). We focus on online, class-incremental scenario where we only trained one epoch. 

Use the following command to run experiments on specific benchmark datasets.
